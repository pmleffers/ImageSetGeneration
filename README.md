# ImageSetGeneration

Backed by popular demand I have streamlined the code for creating a series of computer generated images that can be helpful in training a neural network or can be used for testing inferencing. Basically the script takes in 1 image input and a predefined number of 'scenes' to then returns the predefined number of 'scenes' where your original image is overlayed over a generic background. The script returns the images as well as stores them within a dictionary to be recalled at a later time. Of course you will recognize that with a bit of fiddling you can squeeze the dictionary into a json file for storage and retrieval. 

I will update this as I make more progress but the basics are there in order to get you up and playing around with it.
